        The establishment of these airports have been very important to bring
        the islands closer together and create the connectivity within the
        islands by being a gateway to hop around different parts of the country.
        The proper management of these airports are undeniably paramount to keep
        the tiny islands of Maldives connected. RACL puts together a joint
        effort to preserve this and work towards being the catalyst that not
        only helps connect the islands but also boost the economy towards
        greater development
